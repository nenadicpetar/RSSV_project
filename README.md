Lab assignment for course Real-time Computer Systems. My lab partner an I had assignment to create light system for bike in which, depending on leaning direction, turn indicators are turned on. Also, system must have front light which is turned on automatically, depending on day light, and brake light depending on leaning direction. Sensor that are used in this project are:
-[LED's] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)
-[Photoresistor] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor)
-[GY-521 accelerometer] (https://mschoeffler.com/2017/10/05/tutorial-how-to-use-the-gy-521-module-mpu-6050-breakout-board-with-the-arduino-uno/)
-[Croduino basic module] (https://soldered.com/hr/learn/programiranje-croduino-basic2-iz-arduino-ide/)
